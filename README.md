# Neural-Network-Implementation-from-Scratch-for-Binary-and-3-class-Classification-Using-Python
Implemented and tested a three layered neural network (i.e. 2 hidden layers and one output layer) for binary and three-class classification from scratch using python and without using a GPU framework.  Used spam email data from the UCI repository "spambase" for binary classification. Used CIFAR10 dataset for three-class classification.
